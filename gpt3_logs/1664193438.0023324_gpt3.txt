The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Please rewrite this as a more structured, clear essay.

TRANSCRIPT: tried to like pick one conservative republican one progressive democrat one um uh kind of hyper left or hyper right story from different angles and i would do several of those a week and i just had it as an sms service and i did it manually which took like two hours every um every sunday it was kind of paying the button i eventually gave it up but um it's the kind of thing i suspect that gpt3 could do actually super well both the selecting stories as well as the sending them out and it will say if that's at all in line with what uh you were proposing david there there is a a market for i think i got like 100 numbers signed up at some point um but uh it was too much work to to maintain but yeah anyway just briefly i'm the uh founder at lexi.ai and um so we're building a legal chatbot that provides instant legal answers and connects people to right size legal services but uh i've been a fan of of david's videos i think is probably many folks here have and um so yeah excited to to connect with y'all excellent yeah thanks for jumping in and and totally to what you just mentioned about um you know kind of pulling from different information sources that's really one of the central um central goals of having an information companion or an information concierge but then also the platform that christopher and melody are working on kind of designing and implementing is about not just not just you know how do you protect you know the community's data and and the community's process but also how do you distribute that information in a reliable way and also make it digestible to the people but yeah okay so we are at the end of phase two round robin um so now we can break into more just conventional conversation if anyone wants to jump in feel free to i jotted down a couple questions that i wanted to ask so i'll get started in phase three so question for you christopher and melody um i think you already kind of answered this when you were talking when you're talking about the idea of a civil servant ai um that was uh part of it was to help the community come to consensus and that's something that i've been learning about um so i was wondering if you could speak a little bit more about how you envision um you know an ai and and the deocracy the decentralized democracy um how do you envision consensus and mediation and facilitation of this kind of new structure being implemented or or what are the ins and outs that you've done because i know you've been studying it for a while well at least from the ideological perspective of that question the way it would work would be the ai would be able to connect people with uh aspects of society that they have a vested interest in so let's say i have a child who is in first grade elementary school in the u.s and um i don't want to bother going to town hall because they talk about a bunch of boring stuff that it's not really relevant to me and i've got a little kid at home to take care of and you so on and so forth but the ai could could represent what is going on with the school board and then bring all of that action that they're doing bring it to a vernacular that i understand and say the school board wants to do a b and c and let's say i don't like a that they are doing so now i can can i can communicate to the ai well i don't like a because of this and this and this and the and give all my reasons and then the ai could take that information and then give it back to the school board and if it was doing this with every parent that has children at that elementary school then they would be able to make their decisions better based on what the people with the vested interest in that school would be and it basically would um it would i guess perfect the communication process that instead of one person having to listen to a thousand opinions and create a uh summarization in their own head the ai can communicate with my ai could communicate with everybody else's ais and come to a summarization of 87 of people do not support point a or something like that and that's kind of in a um ideological way how we would envision it working something like that we also know that ai can come up with a ton of different solutions and possibilities and that would be a process of probing people to see what they're open to and what possibly could be implemented though it would have to be multi-steps multi-stages to do something like this yes that that's the other part is say i tell my my ai i don't like point a because of this and this and this and this the ai could then respond to me well um uh what if instead of a we did something like this that's a that sort of accomplishes the same thing as point a but in a different way and then i might be okay with that because most people aren't black and white on things subjects are generally very nuanced and having the ai be able to process why i don't like a and then proposing other solutions to where everyone could be happy with that action would be really cool right yeah i could talk about this for hours um i have envisioned almost that exact functionality as an ultimate one of the ultimate goals for for raven which is to help dispel confusion and and really refine what what people care about and you know specialize in some of those conversational skills so but i don't want to dominate the conversation and i see um uh if there's anyone else who wants to jump in um i know mito you had some great questions earlier rupert you might be on the train um so yeah if anyone else wants to jump in i'm happy to stand aside and let y'all talk but also if not i'm happy to keep talking i think that we would all um enjoy oh yeah hearing some of your ideas okay um yeah i'm happy to um happy to to carry on so one of the to melody's point um about you know having that discussion right it really is about having a dialogue because you know when when a local politician or a big politician some representative comes and has a town hall you know they they listen

CLEAR ESSAY:

==========

I tried to select one conservative republican, one progressive democrat, and one hyper-left or hyper-right story from different angles, and I would do several of these per week. I sent them out as an SMS service, which took me two hours every Sunday. I eventually gave it up, but I think something like this could be done very well with GPT3, both in terms of selecting stories and sending them out.

I'm the founder of Lexi.ai, and we're building a legal chatbot that provides instant legal answers and connects people to the right size legal services. I've been a fan of David's videos, and I'm excited to connect with everyone here.

To what Christopher and Melody just mentioned about pulling from different information sources, that's really one of the central goals of having an information companion or an information concierge. But the platform they're working on is not just about protecting the community's data and process, it's also about distributing that information in a reliable way and making it digestible to people.

So, in terms of how an AI could help facilitate consensus in a decentralized democracy, one way it could work is by connecting people with aspects of society that they have a vested interest in. For example, let's say I have a child in elementary school in the US. I might not want to go to a town hall because they talk about a lot of boring stuff that's not relevant to me. But the AI could represent what's going on with the school board and bring all of that action to a vernacular that I understand. And if the AI was doing this with every parent that has children at that elementary school, then the school board would be able to make better decisions based on what the people with a vested interest in that school want.

Another way the AI could help is by coming up with different solutions and possibilities and probing people to see what they're open to. This would have to be done in multiple steps and stages, but it would be a way to perfect the communication process and make sure that everyone's voices are heard.
